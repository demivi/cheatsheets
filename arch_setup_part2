This part shows how to configure encryption on a secondary drive.
You can apply the same principle to any number of drives.
We will store a keyfile on the main drive to decrypt the secondary drive at boot.

(As a reminder, blocks of commands delimited by ``` can be copy/pasted)

Start a root shell first:
sudo bash

Then define a few variables (the first one MUST match your actual drive name):
```
drive_name="sdb"
keyfile_name="hddkeyfile"
mapping_name="hddcrypt"
mount_point="/hdd"
```

To allow recovery if the main drive fails, define a known passphrase on the LUKS container:
cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/"$drive_name"

Open the LUKS container and format to ext4:
cryptsetup open /dev/"$drive_name" "$mapping_name"
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/"$mapping_name"

Keyfile setup:
```
cryptsetup close "$mapping_name"
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/"$keyfile_name" iflag=fullblock
chmod 600 /etc/"$keyfile_name"
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/"$drive_name" /etc/"$keyfile_name"
```

Auto decryption and mount at boot:
```
UUID=$(lsblk -f | grep "$drive_name " | awk '{print $3}')
echo "$mapping_name UUID=$UUID /etc/$keyfile_name" >> /etc/crypttab
echo "/dev/mapper/$mapping_name $mount_point ext4 defaults 0 2" >> /etc/fstab
```

Now reboot, your drive should be decrypted and mounted on $mount_point
